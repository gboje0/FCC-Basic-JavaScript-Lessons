<h1>Are you working through the Basic JavaScript Lessons/Exercises on FreeCodeCamp?</h1>
<h3>Well these are the solutions that were effective as of the date they were published. You can use them to review and see where you went wrong.</h3>
<p>Personally I rarely check the solutions available, but sometimes the issue is one of interpretation of the instructions. For some reason the instructions on FCC can be quite obtuse considering how many eyes view and review the instructions, but still it's an amazing learning system and it's free, so appreciate and roll with it. Happy Camping!!</p>
